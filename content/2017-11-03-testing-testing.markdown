Welcome to the official website and blog of Kiwi TCMS.
We are happy to finally be online!

This website was built with the help of
[Kaloyan Krastev](https://github.com/koksyncho),
[Tsvetoslav Garkov](https://github.com/FreshyMc) and
[Ivaylo Ivanov](https://github.com/ivo0126)
who will be joining the project a bit later as well.

In this blog you can expect various news and progress reports around the project,
announcement of new releases and future plans. We would love to hear your
feedback so please use the comments form below.

Happy testing!
